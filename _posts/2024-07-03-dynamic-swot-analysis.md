A Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis is a versatile tool that assists economic agents—both organizations and individuals—in making informed decisions by providing a clear picture of the internal and external factors impacting their objectives. By systematically identifying and analyzing these factors, agents can develop effective strategies to optimize their goals and maintain a competitive edge. A common misconception I have observed as an economics and finance educator is the presentation of SWOT as a static phenomenon—it is not. SWOT is continually evolving. A basic understanding of information economics and efficient markets explains why this is the case. Consequently, when making a pitch, presenting a SWOT analysis without a reference timeframe indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the dynamic nature of these factors. The presentation of facts in this article is from a stock analysis SWOT perspective but can be generalized to any other application as well.

## Strengths

These are a strictly convex decaying function due to market learning. Over time, what was once a strength can diminish as competitors catch up and market conditions change.

## Weaknesses

These follow a strictly concave increasing function as they tend to compound over time if not addressed.

## Opportunities

These are fleeting and must be seized promptly, as they can disappear as quickly as they arise. Always use an appropriate discount rate!

## Threats

These are persistent and often require ongoing attention and mitigation strategies such as risk management / diversification.


## Remarks

It is quite possible that artificial intelligence startups and technology companies will come to realize the substantial economic costs associated with training models, especially when factoring in the immense social and environmental impacts. When this occurs, the artificial intelligence sector is likely to undergo consolidation, leading to a decline in the demand for physical capital inputs. Consequently, Nvidia's market will contract. Given the high investor expectations for Nvidia's stock appreciation, a reduction in Nvidia's customer base will trigger a correction towards fundamental values. This adjustment will likely bring the stock price back to a level where the price-to-earnings ratio aligns with market peer averages, estimated around 35.
