Nvidia (Ticker: $NVDA) supplies the lion's share of high resource-dependent[^1] physical capital factor inputs[^2] to companies building artificial intelligence training models. Nvidia's customer pool is diverse, including tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook, as well as cloud service providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Additionally, Nvidia serves self-driving vehicle companies like Tesla and Waymo, healthcare and biotech firms such as Recursion Pharmaceuticals, and financial institutions including JPMorgan Chase.

Moreover, Nvidia's clientele extends to natural language processing (NLP) companies, AI research labs, and chip startups like OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, and Scale AI. The company also caters to entertainment and gaming graphics companies, such as Midjourney. Beyond these, Nvidia supports a wide array of technology startups including the 19,000 recipients of the Nvidia Inception grant.

It is important to note that the above listed pool does not include the millions of retail users (gamers, developers, and performance hardware owners) and the Web 3.0[^3] users (blockchain miners and dApp builders) because they are not directly involved in artifical intelligence sector. Nevertheless, the artifical intelligence sector is large. How can a new economy industry sector like artifical intelligence become so big so fast?[^4] And, more importantly, what is its economic consequence?

# Economic analysis of artificial intelligence firms

The analysis of artificial intelligence companies is not only to look at how efficiently does the capital investments in factor inputs yield economic profits but also to tabulate all externalities of such capital investments. And, on the topic of capital investments, the role of large players differ than the smaller startups. For one, large corporations' capital investments in artificial intelligence is risk-shared with other prospects in their investment set. Second, large corporations have existing commitments to abide by climate accords and reduce environmental footprint over the next decade. Third, large corporations cause higher externality effects. Smaller artificial intelligence startups, on the other hand, are exposed to same business risks as any other startup, ranging from increased default risk[^5] to the lack of a product variety[^6].

## Economic profits

What is the return to artificial intelligence capital investment?



Let's conduct a simple economic cost analysis for hashtag#AI training.

I. Energy
hashtag#AI training can produce significant carbon emissions, depending on the energy sources used. Some companies are moving towards using renewable energy for their data centers to mitigate this impact. Nevertheless, these are energy sources that were earmarked for other residential and commercial uses to reduce our carbon footprint and put us on path in achieving the Climate Accord Carbon Emission goals. Can hashtag#AI technology companies still claim that they are carbon net neutral?

II. Water
Data centers used for AI require substantial cooling, often using water-based systems. This can strain local water resources, especially in water-scarce regions. World Resources Institute reports that, in the next decade, 25 countries, housing one-quarter of the global population, face extremely high water stress, and we can expect these populace to migrate to regions with water. About $70 trillion in GDP (31% of global GDP) will be exposed to high water stress by 2050. Can societies afford water allocation to hashtag#AI systems?

III. E-waste
Considering the entire life cycle of AI systems manufactured by hashtag#Nvidia, from manufacturing to disposal, the rapid advancement of AI technology leads to frequent hardware upgrades. 2022 chipsets were outdated in 2023, 2023 chipsets were outdated in 2024. And, we can reasonably expect, based on Moore's law, that the trend will continue. Can our landfills and oceans take more electronic waste - that are heavy metal rich?

Sooner or later, hashtag#AI companies are going to weigh in the cost against the perceived gains of hashtag#AI training, and the marginal product of hashtag#AI investments is going to decline. 

WHAT HAPPENS TO hashtag#NVIDIA WHEN THAT HAPPENS?

Did the financials already signal hashtag#NVIDIA's demise?

hashtag#Nvidia has a PE of 80. A P/E of 80 indicates that investors are willing to pay $80 for every $1 of earnings the company generates. Put another way, investors have to wait 80 earnings cycles to get their money back for the price that they paid. The investor bet, however, is that it is possible that hashtag#Nvidia stock appreciates sufficiently (say, 10x) so that that wait-time is considerably lower. 

Then the question remains: Can hashtag#Nvidia 10x? That puts it at $27 Trillion market capitalization. That's higher than the entire US Annual GDP less government spending (Consumption, Investments, and Net Exports) or about $10 Trillion more than entire China's GDP. In my opinion and by every reasonable metric, that's never going to happen! Then, why are investors buying hashtag#Nvidia at such a premium and why are hashtag#analysts still recommending a hashtag#BUY? In a nutshell, it is because they don't understand the hashtag#AI landscape and are driven by buzz words.
