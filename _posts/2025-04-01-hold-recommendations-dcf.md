While valuation models provide relatively clear guidance for `BUY` and `SELL` recommendations, the analysis of a `HOLD` recommendation is rather tricky. Generally speaking, a HOLD recommendation is given when the stock's intrinsic modeling value is approximately equal to its current market price. That is, non-shareholders should refrain from initiating positions and current shareholders should maintain their existing positions.

## Secondary checks for HOLD recommendations is always warranted.

In corporate finance theory, a HOLD recommendation is justified only when the modeler finds no meaningful difference between the stock's DCF valuation and its historical performance or industry benchmarks. Put simply, the stock should not have any near-term growth catalysts.

- no M&A activity
- no recent changes in leadership
- no new technology, and more importantly ...
- no changes in spending (R&D, Capex, SG&A).

If that is not the case, advise HOLD with caution!

## The 10% rule is debatable.

Best practices suggest issuing a HOLD recommendation when your analysis projects a target price within ±10% of the current stock price—a threshold derived from annualized long-run market performance (e.g., S&P Index 10-year returns). This 10% guideline is only valid when comparison timelines align. While the S&P historically averages 10% annual returns, how quickly does the stock corrects its misvaluation is not bound by specific timeframes and depends on, 

- Industry trends
- Market sentiment
- Historical volatility
- Institutional trading patterns
- Company-specific developments

## ANR conformance does not matter
